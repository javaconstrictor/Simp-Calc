This project was made initially by following a BroCode tutorial on YouTube to learn about GUI integration. 
I made a few changes to improve some functionality i felt was needed, and some styling improvements.
functionality limits usage of the keyboard to type in numbers, any you may only do one function at a time. 
example-- typing 2 + 2 + 2 and pressing the equals sign will output 4. this could be improved by changing the program to read the typed string
without reseting anything and finding operators, but was past the scope of this project, as my main goal was purely to implement a gui.
